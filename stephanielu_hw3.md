**Author:** Stephanie Lu

GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/stephanielu/mtcars-flask-api](https://github.com/eshlu/mtcars-flask-api)

This project builds a predictive linear regression model using the `mtcars.csv` dataset, containerizes it with Docker, and deploys it as a REST API on Google Cloud Run using Flask.

The repository contains:
- A trained model for predicting MPG based on car features
- A Flask API served from a Docker container
- DockerHub-published image for reproducibility
- Deployment instructions and curl examples for testing the API

To deploy and test the API, follow the directions in [`deployment/README.md`](deployment/README.md).
